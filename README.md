# react-native
An app that helps you save your location, in React Native

_Still under development_

If you want to see what I'm doing (at your own risk :P) clone this repo run `npm install` and then `react-native run-ios`.

### You can add your own location in a list ###
(_Also rename and delete it_)

### You can then navigate to this location by clicking ###
_If you have gmaps or citymapper installed you will be asked with which one you want to open the directions_

### You can add your location with the help of a map and a marker ###
